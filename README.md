## Deployment
#### Deploying to Vercel

Follow these steps to build and deploy your project to Vercel.

#### Step 1 :  Install Vercel CLI Globally

Install the Vercel CLI globally on your machine:


```bash
  npm i -g vercel   
```
#### Step 2 : Verify Installation

Check if Vercel is installed correctly by running the following command:

```bash

```

If the CLI is installed correctly, you'll see the Vercel dashboard in your terminal.

```
#### Step 4 : Deploy to a Preview Environment
Deploy your project to a preview environment by running:
